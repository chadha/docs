      <description>Custom Roles and Permissions for Applications By default, the OLT platform checks whether a user has the read or write OLT permission to access a specific endpoint.
With custom applications, you access the OLT API endpoints. With custom roles, you can assign custom permissions to control on a more granular level what a user is allowed to do with a custom application.
So, a part of designing custom applications is to determine whether you wish to define custom roles.</description>
